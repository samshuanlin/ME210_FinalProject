## Existing Files
- ```src/main.cpp```. You should create your own main.cpp file. This is the file that you will run Arduino code with. Remember to ```#include <Arduino.h>```.
- ```test```:
    - ```LSM9DS1_calibration.cpp```: the file Sam is using to look into magnetometer calibration. You should not have to worry about this file (as the library associated with it is quite huge).
    - ```RCWL1601_test.cpp```: simple test file for the ultrasonic sensor that works. Will likely have to be changed to be triggered by timer interrupts.
